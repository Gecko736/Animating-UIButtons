# Animating-UIButtons

I was watching a tutorial about animating buttons, and after applying it to my project, I ended up with a class that someone
else might find useful. It's called Ani.swift. It only has one function called mate that takes a button and applies a one time
animation to it. There are three animation options, .fill, .shake, and .flash. You call the function like this:

	Ani.mate(yourButton, style: .fill)

I've attached the swift file to this post in case anyone wants to use it. I added comments
so that you can edit the animations without having to watch the tutorial.
